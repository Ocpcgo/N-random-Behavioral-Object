# N-random-Behavioral-Object

Let's say there are n objects (with n variables that I can input any integer value). These n objects can be thought of as human faces. At the start, all n objects will be "facing" one of their neighbors (by neighbor, I mean an object that is directly adjacent to it). The direction in which each object faces is randomly determined. Now, if an object is facing another object that is itself facing another object, then the first object will follow the facing direction of the object it is facing.
